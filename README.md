# Footy Planner

Fancied learn something new so converting somewhat usable version of my angular 12 app for planning 3G/4G pitch games into Svelte cause why not... :D

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Running the tests

You can run the Playwright tests via a command prompt with:

```bash
npm run test
```

You can also run them via the Playwright VS Code extension

### Structure of the app
[This should follow a basic project structure of any svelteKit app. Decided to follow someone's standard for once..](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure)
